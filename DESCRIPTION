Description: Create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistics with the lipidomeR.
    The lipidomeR provides a streamlined pipeline for systematic 
    interpretation of the lipidome through publication-ready visualizations 
    of regression models fitted on lipidomics data. 
    With lipidomeR, associations between covariates and the lipidome 
    can be interpreted systematically and intuitively through heatmaps, where 
    lipids are organized based on their class, size and level of saturation.
    With lipidomeR, you can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of 
    statistical associations, changes or differences. 
    lipidomeR helps you to immediately understand complex patterns 
    in high-dimensional lipidomics data. 
    The heatmaps are provided with publication-ready quality and 
    the results behind the visualizations are based on rigorous statistical 
    models. 
    In lipidomeR heatmaps, lipids are categorized by the lipid class and 
    presented on a two-dimensional map in terms of their size and 
    level of saturation, providing a systems-level understanding of changes in 
    the lipidome.
