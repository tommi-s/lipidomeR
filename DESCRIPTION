Description: lipidomeR provides tools for rapid and reproducible 
    visualization of associations in high-dimensional lipidomics data. 
    With lipidomeR, you can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of 
    statistical associations and differences. 
    Heatmaps from lipidomeR help you immediately understand complex patterns 
    in lipidomics data. 
    The heatmaps are provided with publication-ready quality. 
    In lipidomeR heatmaps, lipids are categorized by the lipid class and 
    presented on a two-dimensional map in terms of their size and 
    level of saturation. 
    This approach gives the opportunity to interpret lipidomic patterns in 
    a systematic and intuitive way.
